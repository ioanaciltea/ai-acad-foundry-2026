"""The local agent — the persona runs in *your* process, against any provider.

This is the honest minimum of what an "agent" is when you strip the marketing:
a persona (instructions + rules), optional retrieved context, and a model call.
No platform required — it works with OpenAI, Anthropic, LM Studio or Foundry,
and it is what runs when AGENT_MODE=local.

Compare with foundry_agent.py, where the same persona is hosted by Azure and the
loop runs on Microsoft's side.
